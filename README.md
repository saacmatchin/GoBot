# GoBot
IRC BoT

is on heavy development,
for now it only does a couple things
!help
!wiki <word to search for>
and will get the info to any URL posted on the irc channel

to run as a daemon install "daemonize"
and see run.sh modify to your own path/needs

ok now it will connect to your local TOR router so all searchs and functions are done using TOR
to not expose server IP
