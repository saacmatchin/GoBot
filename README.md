# GoBot
IRC BoT by ReK2 [hispagatos](https://Hispagatos.org)


**is on heavy development**  

Came back to this after 2 years because now we are back to use IRC in i2p  

for now it only does a couple things  
!help
!wiki <word to search for>  
and will get the info to any URL posted on the irc channel  

to run as a daemon install "daemonize"  
and see run.sh modify to your own path/needs  


# added TOR 2016  
ok now it will connect to your local TOR router so all searchs and functions are done using TOR
to not expose server/local IP
# Added 28/03/2018  
- Updated depedency libs and changed some third party function calls to revive the code
- Added daemon capability, durty hack for now..
